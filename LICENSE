the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the
law. These terms do not limit them.

granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply
any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If
your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends

## Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have
violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,

32 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses
end immediately.
